## Description:

Our capstone project was to automate the incredibly monotonous task of reviewing test footage of a spectrum analyzer which previously required an operator to manually review the footage and record all relevant data by hand. These videos could be up to 8 hours in length which represents a large expenditure of human resources to carry out. So it follows that our goal was to dramatically reduce the time it takes to produce this data while requiring little input from operators.

## Problems to solve

The task of automating the analysis can be broken down into four main tasks:

- Grid detection: finding the bounds of the grid any where inside of the frame
- Signal detection: isolating the signal displayed on the grid in each frame to determine center frequency and power of signal peaks
- Detection of current spectrum analyzer settings: Spectrum analyzers have many settings which define the extrema of the detected grid in real units allowing us to turn relative positional measurements into real readings
- Data storage: write all the collected data to a CSV for further analysis

## Key Technologies Utilized:

- Python: choosing python as the language to implement our project was relatively easy given the large amount of libraries in the python ecosystem
- CV2: A computer vision library utilized heavily in the detection of grids and signal detection
- EasyOCR: an optical character recognition library utilized in the detection of spectrum analyzer settings
- PyQT5: a UI library that allowed us to create an intuitive graphical user interface

## Results

- All requirements were fulfilled over the course of the semester including an additional GUI to improve user experience
- Accurate data was produced in all test footage provided by the sponsor
- Processing times were reduced by up to 80% when compared to previous manual review.
